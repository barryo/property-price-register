Irish Residential Property Price Database


## About

This site is a quick hack by [Open Solutions](http://www.opensolutions.ie/) to make the Residential Property 
Pricing database  more easily accessible than the very poor and cumbersome effort by the 
[Property Services Regulatory Authority](http://propertypriceregister.ie/) themselves.

This site is built using open source software from jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap and DataTables.
